        <p class="text-justify text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Text justification ensures that the paragraph aligns with both the left and right margins, creating a clean and professional look. This is especially useful for content-rich websites like blogs, news articles, and formal reports. It enhances readability by maintaining visual balance and consistency across lines.
          <br><br>
          However, it's important to use justification wisely, as it can sometimes introduce awkward spacing between words. Tailwind CSS makes it easy to apply justification using the <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded text-sm">text-justify</code> class.
